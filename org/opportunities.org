You must possess the following:

A desire to learn about real estate, and proven consistent success in another industry.

The ability to find the answer - don't tell just me there's a problem.

Not intimidated by learning new applications and realtor systems online. Ask me the question, write down the answer, so you don't have to ask it again.

The ability to respond to phone calls and incoming correspondence quickly.

The desire to learn the real estate industry ins- and - outs by doing all (yes, I do mean all) the necessary transaction paperwork in our online systems.

Reliability. Accountability. Sense of Humor. This business is not for the faint of heart. But it can be fun, exciting and rewarding helping people buy their piece of the American dream.

I currently have 30 active and pending listings and more coming on every week.

Willing to work around your schedule but it must be 4 hours a day/ 5days a week in the office. Discipline is key.

Okay, so what's in for you?

After a 2 month trial, where I will train you on our systems and processes, I will pay for your RE Class, your MA Real Estate Salesperson Test, and your associated fees and dues. Not interested in getting your real estate license that is o.k. too.

You will be paid weekly, as an independent contractor.
You will be joining the *fastest growing real estate agency in Worcester County*.
You will learn more working with me and then have the ability to work as an agent and hit the ground running, rather than as a new agent floundering around.
I will give you all the leads and buyers you can handle. Your income potential is huge.

But you have to prove yourself to me.

Recent college grads (English, Marketing, History?) and stay at home moms re-entering the work force encouraged to apply.

No phone calls please, my phone rings off he hook.

Dear Hiring Manager

I'm replying to your ad seeking a Part-time Leasing Consultant. Assuming the position is still available, this would fit my situation extremely well as I'm primarily looking for part-time employment at this time.

You will find that my background in the resume below might fit your situation very well,  as I do have a experience in real estate and lending
which in many ways are similar to the leasing industry. Your desire for someone upbeat, outgoing, customer service oriented fits my personality, skills and professional demeanor that is needed as an IT professional (servicing a nationwide customer base) or as Concierge in the exclusive Boston West End apartments.

Although my qualifications might seem very technical you will see as highlighted below I also have great success in sales and promotional related functions. My computer skills are exceptional as that was my primary function and this required good organization and the ability to manage multiple priorities in a complex problem oriented IT environment.

If you are seeking a dependable, quality individual that will help you grow your business and work weekends I can be reached at the information below.

Thank you for your consideration.

compensation: Base $10.50/HR, Average $12/HR, Best $15/HR
employment type: part-time

If you want to have an impact on our country -- if you want a job with flexible hours to work around your school OR your kids' school and daycare -- if you want a job where you can immediately dive in with OUR training and begin making bonuses -- if you want a job with supervisors and managers who understand that you have a home and family that comes first -- THEN JOIN US!

We are Integral Resources, Inc.; in business since 1990, and now in four states. We are looking for Call Center Agents to connect progressive nonprofit and political organizations to their donors. Agents are taught how to read a script on the screen and ask each donor for a gift a minimum of three times, responding to questions and objections appropriately.

We are looking for polite, energetic, persistent people -- Must be 18+, fluent in English, and able to read well -- Must have no felony background (many states have laws for handling credit card data).

We offer flexible schedules, ongoing coaching and training, weekly paycheck with an annual W-2, and pay raises at one year and two years. Receive an hourly base pay PLUS bonuses paid for credit card donations, working over 26 hours, and general productivity. We have frequent contests for cash or prizes, and always opportunities to earn more with incentives.

You pick the days and times that work best for you, from 16.5 up to 40 hours a week.

Weekday shifts from:
8:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
5:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.

Weekend shifts from:
Saturday: 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.
Sunday: 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.

This is a permanent job, NOT a temp position or 90 day assignment; NOT commission only. Average agents are making $12 / hour and top agents much more. Company sponsored health insurance is available for those consistently working over 30 hours. All of our supervisors and managers started as agents; promotion is fully from within.

Interviews are conducted Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. -- 4 p.m. Walk-ins are welcome during those hours but to schedule an appointment, or for further questions, reply via email or call 508-926-8051.
